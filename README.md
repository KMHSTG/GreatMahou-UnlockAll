# **Great Mahou Daisakusen - Unlock Secret Characters**

These patches will unlock the secret characters by default, in the Great Mahou Daisakusen and Dimahoo MAME roms. They have no other effect.

## Patching Instructions:

1 - Extract your MAME Great Mahou Daisakusen (gmahou.zip) or Dimahoo (dimahoo.zip) rom archive.

2 - Using your xdelta patcher of choice, apply the xdelta patch that matches your rom to the ".03" file. Usually this will be "gmdj.03" for gmahou, and "gmde.03" for dimahoo. Make sure that your patched file has the same filename as the original.

3 - Rezip the Great Mahou Daisakusen or Dimahoo rom archive.
  
  
##### NOTE: When you start up the patched rom, MAME will complain about wrong checksum. This is expected, and can be safely ignored. If necessary, the patching process can be verified using the hashes below:
